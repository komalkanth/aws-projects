## Context

An **AWS Three Tier Web Architecture** project *loosely* based on the sample project here. https://github.com/harishnshetty/3-tier-aws-15-services

I say *loosely* because the application portion of the project has been used from that project, since I do not come from that background. I will also be using a similar infra around the application but using ideas that come from my own experience in the last couple of years.

I will try to add as much complexity in this project so that it can highlight some of the things I'm capable of doing.
